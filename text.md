1. Which two countries have you chosen? Why did you choose them? (SHORT ANSWER)
   I have chosen to look more into the American cultural aspect and compare it to my Swedish
   culture. I picked The United States cause it’s a country I have always been interested in. And
   In some way it almost feels like home after I've been watching thousands of Hollywood
   productions and tv shows over the years .
2. Have you visited the english speaking country you have chosen to speak about?
   could you tell us what you thought of it? If you have not, can you imagine what it would be
   like to travel there? (SHORT ANSWER)
   I’ve been to America many times, traveling on the road from coast to coast. On trips like that
   you get to see the most attractive and silent desert or palm tree landscapes to the loudest
   most chaotic cities. I always loved the diversity of the environment in America, and the people
   there are really nice and easy to deal with, even if they’re sometimes a bit different from us
   Swedes.
3. What role does the English language have in both countries? How much is it used?
   (SHORT ANSWER)
   The United States has actually no official language but 90% of the American citizens speak
   English and the country is led by an English speaking government. Sweden on the other
   side has Swedish as their official language, but in modern times English goes pretty much
   side by side with swedish. A few of many reasons is that English is compulsory in Swedish
   schools and it’s almost impossible for people to watch movies and tv-shows with voice
   overs.
