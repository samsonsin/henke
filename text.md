1. Which two countries have you chosen? Why did you choose them? (SHORT ANSWER)
   I have chosen to examine American culture and contrast it to Swedish
   culture. I chose The United States because it’s a country I've always been interested in.
   In some ways it almost feels like a second home; after I've watched thousands of Hollywood
   productions over the years, The United States of America has settled into a special place in my heart.
2. Have you visited the english speaking country you have chosen to speak about?
   could you tell us what you thought of it? If you have not, can you imagine what it would be
   like to travel there? (SHORT ANSWER)
   I’ve been to America many times; travelling by car coast to coast. On such trips
   you get to see a wide variety of scenes; from the most serene of tropics to the loudest and
   most chaotic cities. I have always loved the diverse environment in America, and the people
   there are nice and easy to deal with, even if they’re sometimes a bit different from us
   Swedish natives
3. What role does the English language have in both countries? How much is it used?
   (SHORT ANSWER)
   The United States has no official language on the federal level, but both a vast majority of American citizens speak English and the country is led by a government that communicates primarily in English. Contrasting this; Sweden's official language is determined to be swedish. However, in modern times English goes pretty much
   hand in hand with swedish. There are a variety of reasons for this, such as English being compulsory in Swedish education. As a consequence of this, movies and tv-shows with voice
   overs are much sparser than in other countries.
